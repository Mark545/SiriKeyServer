This Is An Updated (And Upgraded) Version Of The Siri Server From Applidium Cracking Siri.
This Can Also Get Siri Working On Your iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4!

To Get Siri On Your iPhone 3GS Or 4 (Or iPod Touch 4) Follow These Steps:
1. Download The Spire Tweak From Cydia On The Device You Want To Run Siri On
2. On Your Desired Server Machine, Download This Repository Like This:
# git clone git://github.com/firebolt55439/SiriKeyServer.git
Then:
# sudo ./install.sh 
Which Does All The Configuring For You, And Generates The Certificates For SSL.

3. On Your Desired Server Machine, Configure A Dns Server (dns.py, dnsmasq, bind9, etc.) to forward guzzoni.apple.com
To Your Computers' IP With The siri.rb File Running
4. Download And Install n00neimp0rtant's Tweak (Sirious) And Install It On Your Jailbroken Device. Respring Your Device ASAP! 
(This will be the device that you will run Siri on)
5. Run This Command On Your Siri Server:
# sudo ruby siri.rb > keys.txt
--> Or If You Have RVM Installed:
# rvmsudo siri.rb > keys.txt

6. With The 4[S], Configure It To Connect To Your DNS Server, And Use Siri.
7. Quit The siri.rb y Pressing Control C. Your Keys Are Saved In The keys.txt file.
8. Download n00neimp0rtant ruby convert.rb (or whatever it's called) file to your server
9. Edit It And Paste Your Session Validation Data.
10. Record The Output Of It, And SSH Into Your Jailbroken iPhone and paste in all the data (X-ace-host, aced, etc.) in:
/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.n00neimp0rtant.sirious.plist (Or Some File Named Like That).
--> Make Sure The Session Validation Data Has Already Been Converted! If It Hasn't, Do Steps 8-9.
11. Respring Your Jailbroken Device And Enjoy Siri!


Here Are Some Errors You May Have And How To Fix Them:

Error: 
./siri.rb:40:in unbind': undefined method 'close' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
Or:
./siriServer.rb:40:in unbind': undefined method 'close' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
If You're Using The Applidium Cracking Siri Tools.

Fix:
This Error Is Related To The @ztream.close Line Where @ztream Is Zlib::Inflate:New.
Zlib::Inflate:New Is A Class For Decompressing Zlib Compressed Data. This Error Does Not Have A 100%-Fix-Guarantee Solution, But I Think You Should Try These Steps:

If You're Using The Server To Grab Keys From An iPhone 4 And You're Getting The Above Error, Download The sirifori4.rb Instead Of The siri.rb Or siriServer.rb File And Run It.
The Files Are Located In This Project. 

If You Have An iPhone 4[S] And You're Getting The Above Error, Do These Steps:
1. Download iBackupBot Backup Reading Utility For Your Operating System [Mac/PC]
	(If You're On Linux, Then Use A Windows Or Mac Computer To Do These Steps)
2. Open This File: /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.plist In A Text Editor. (Notepad, TextEdit, Etc. But NOT Microsoft Word)
3. Edit Out The Hostname (https://guzzoni.apple.com) And Replace It With Your Proxy Servers IP (ie: https://YOUR_IP_HERE:443) 
	Remember To Include The :443 At The End Of The URL!!!!
4. Reboot Your iPhone 4[S] And Get The siri.rb File Ready [Start It].
5. Try Siri From Somewhere [Notes, Mail, etc.] And Watch As The Keys Are Printed Out!

Error:
start_tcp_server': no acceptor (RuntimeError)

Fix:
You Forgot To Use Sudo (No Administrative/Root Privileges) :
Do This: 
# sudo ruby siri.rb  
Instead Of: 
# ruby siri.rb
